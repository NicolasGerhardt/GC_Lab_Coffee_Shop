## Part 1
### Task
Create a User Registration Form using the MVC framework.

### What does the application do?
1. The Index View should have an action link pointing to the registration page.
1. The registration page will register a new user. The form should take in the user’s first and last name, email, and password.
1. When submitted, the page should redirect the user to a summary on a different page. This page will show a message => Welcome {UserName}
1. Go crazy! Design the form by adding different kinds of controls, such as text boxes, drop down lists, radio buttons, and check boxes.

### Build Specifications
* Index page has a working action link to the registration page (1 point).
* Registration page has a form with a valid action and method (1 point) and the four required fields (1 point each = 4 points).
* Result controller takes all four fields correctly through GET or POST (2 points), then returns a view (1 point), passing the correct information along (1 point).
* Result page shows at least the user’s first name with a welcome message (1 point).

### Extended Challenges
* Do form validation! Use HTML5, Controller C# code using regular expressions, or any other methods you can come up with to do validation. Make up your own rules for a valid password.
